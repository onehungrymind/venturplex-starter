# Welcome to the Core State Library

This library is created to contain the applications state layer. We are handling state with [NGRX](https://ngrx.io/). As NGRX puts it, "NgRx provides state management for creating maintainable explicit applications, by storing single state and the use of actions in order to express state changes."
