# Welcome To The Material Library

This library was created to better control UI peices used within an app. We generally use Angular Material in all of our Angular apps. Creating this lib just makes it easier to decide what UI modules we use throughout all apps.

## Enabling Gesture Recognition

When generating a new application and desire mobile gesture recognition, please import `hammerjs` in the apps `main.ts` file.
